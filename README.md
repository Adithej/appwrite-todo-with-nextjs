## 🎬 Getting Started

### 🤘 Install Appwrite 
Follow our simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice. 

> Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend can access it.
  
We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server. 



### **Run locally**

Follow these instructions to run the demo app locally

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/sooraj-s-98/todo-with-nextjs
$ cd todo-with-nextjs
```

Run the following command to generate your `.env` vars

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Now fill in the envrionment variables we discussed above in your `.env`

Now run the following commands and you should be good to go 💪🏼

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## 😧 Help Wanted 
Our access credentials were recently compromised and someone tried to ruin these demos. They decided to leave behind 15 easter eggs 🥚 for you to discover. If you find them, submit a PR cleaning up that section of the code (One PR per person across all the repos). You can track the number of claimed Easter Eggs using the badge at the top.

The first 15 people to get their PRs merged will receive some Appwrite Swags 🤩 . Just head over to our [Discord channel](https://appwrite.io/discord) and share your PR link with us.
